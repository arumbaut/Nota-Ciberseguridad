#### Types of SQL Injection

- **Union-based SQLi:** Using the UNION SQL operator to combine the results of the original query with the results of an attacker-controlled query.
- **Error-based SQLi:** Forcing the database to generate an error, revealing information about the database structure.
- **Blind SQLi:** The attacker doesn't get the results of the SQL query in the HTTP response but can infer if the payload was executed based on the application's response.
- **Time-based Blind SQLi:** Inferring if the payload was executed based on the time the server takes to respond.
- **Out-of-Band SQLi:** The results of the SQL query are sent to an external server controlled by the attacker.
- **Second Order SQLi:** The payload is stored by the application and used in a later SQL query.
- **Stored Procedure Attacks:** Calling stored procedures from the SQL injection point.
- **Function Call Payloads:** Calling database functions from the SQL injection point.
- **Boolean-based SQLi:** Sending a SQL query that will return a different result depending on whether the condition in the query is true or false.
- **Content-based SQLi:** Sending a SQL query that will return a different result depending on the content of the HTTP response.

### Malware Analysis

- **Static Analysis:**
    - **Header Examination:** Look at the headers of the executable file. Common executable file formats include PE (Portable Executable) for Windows and ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) for Linux.
    - **Disassembly:** Disassemble the binary code using a disassembler such as IDA Pro, Ghidra, or Radare2. These tools can help you navigate the assembly code and identify the entry point.
- **Dynamic Analysis:**
    - **Debugger:** Use a debugger like OllyDbg, WinDbg, or GDB to run the executable in a controlled environment. Set breakpoints and step through the code until you reach the entry point.
    - **Monitoring Tools:** Use tools like Process Monitor (ProcMon) on Windows or strace on Linux to monitor system calls and identify when the executable is loaded and starts executing.
- **Strings and Signatures:**
    - **String Analysis:** Look for strings within the executable that may indicate the entry point. Some malware authors leave identifiable strings.
    - **Signature-Based Detection:** Use antivirus or anti-malware tools that might have signature databases to identify known malware and their entry points.
- **Code Emulation and Analysis:**
    - **Sandboxing:** Execute the executable in a controlled environment, often called a sandbox, and monitor its behavior. Analyze the log or output for indications of the entry point.
